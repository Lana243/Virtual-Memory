# Virtual-Memory
The research project dedicated to the virtual memory
1. Implemented Julia modules with different substitution algorithms such as FIFO (first in first out), LRU (last recently used) and OPT (optimal).

 2. Compared different substitution algorithms.
 
 3. Implemented Julia module with tests.
 
 4. Added logging.
